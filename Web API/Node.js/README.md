# Example with Node.js

Creating a RESTful API with Node.js is a popular choice due to its lightweight and efficient runtime. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a simple API using Node.js and Express.js, one of the most common frameworks for building Node.js applications.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).
A text editor or IDE of your choice, like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

## Step 2: Create a New Node.js Project
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using your terminal or command prompt.

Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

```
npm init -y
```

This command generates a package.json file with default settings.

Install Express.js, a minimal web application framework for Node.js:


npm install express --save

## Step 3: Define a Data Model
In this example, let's create a simple API for managing a list of tasks. Define a data model for tasks in a file (e.g., task.js):

```
class Task {
    constructor(id, title, completed) {
        this.id = id;
        this.title = title;
        this.completed = completed;
    }
}

module.exports = Task;
```

## Step 4: Create an Express.js App

Create a JavaScript file (e.g., app.js) to set up your Express.js application:
```
const express = require('express');
const Task = require('./task');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const tasks = [];

app.get('/api/tasks', (req, res) => {
    res.json(tasks);
});

app.post('/api/tasks', (req, res) => {
    const task = new Task(tasks.length + 1, req.body.title, false);
    tasks.push(task);
    res.status(201).json(task);
});

// Add routes for updating and deleting tasks as needed

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Step 5: Run Your Node.js Application
You can start your Node.js application by running the following command:

```
node app.js
```

This command starts your Express.js server on port 3000 (or the port defined in the PORT environment variable).

## Step 6: Test Your API
Use a tool like Postman to test your API. Send HTTP requests to the defined endpoints (e.g., GET /api/tasks, POST /api/tasks, PUT /api/tasks/{id}, DELETE /api/tasks/{id}).

## Step 7: Documentation (Optional)
You can use tools like Swagger or API documentation generators to create documentation for your API.

Congratulations! You've created a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. You can expand on this foundation by adding authentication, validation, and more complex business logic as needed for your project. Node.js offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules to help you build powerful and scalable APIs.
